Yes, the cloned VMs will be independent of future changes to the original VM. The linked clones use the state of the VM or snapshot at the time of cloning as a backing file. Any subsequent changes to the original VM or its snapshots won't affect the existing clones.

Hereâ€™s the revised script to ensure that the original VM can be altered without affecting the clones:

### Script: Creating a Linked Clone

This script ensures that the cloned VM remains independent of future changes to the original VM by using the current disk state or a specified snapshot.

```python
import libvirt
import sys
import os

def create_linked_clone(vm_name, clone_name, snapshot_name=None):
    try:
        conn = libvirt.open('qemu:///system')
        if conn is None:
            print("Failed to open connection to qemu:///system")
            sys.exit(1)

        dom = conn.lookupByName(vm_name)
        if dom is None:
            print(f"Failed to find the domain {vm_name}")
            sys.exit(1)

        # Get the original disk path
        xml_desc = dom.XMLDesc()
        disk_path = None
        for line in xml_desc.splitlines():
            if "<source file=" in line:
                disk_path = line.split("'")[1]
                break
        
        if disk_path is None:
            print("Failed to find the original disk path")
            sys.exit(1)

        # Determine the backing file
        backing_file = disk_path

        if snapshot_name:
            snapshot = dom.snapshotLookupByName(snapshot_name)
            snapshot_xml = snapshot.getXMLDesc()
            for line in snapshot_xml.splitlines():
                if "<source file=" in line:
                    backing_file = line.split("'")[1]
                    break

        # Create a new qcow2 disk for the clone with the backing file
        clone_disk_path = f"/var/lib/libvirt/images/{clone_name}.qcow2"
        os.system(f"qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o backing_file={backing_file} {clone_disk_path}")

        # Create a new XML description for the cloned VM
        clone_xml = xml_desc.replace(vm_name, clone_name)
        clone_xml = clone_xml.replace(disk_path, clone_disk_path)

        # Define the new domain
        conn.createXML(clone_xml, 0)

        print(f"Linked clone {clone_name} created for domain {vm_name}")

        conn.close()
    except libvirt.libvirtError as e:
        print(f"Failed to create linked clone: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

# Usage: create_linked_clone("your_vm_name", "your_clone_name", "optional_snapshot_name")
create_linked_clone("your_vm_name", "your_clone_name", "optional_snapshot_name")
```

### Usage

- To create a linked clone based on the current state of the VM:
  ```python
  create_linked_clone("your_vm_name", "your_clone_name")
  ```

- To create a linked clone based on a specific snapshot:
  ```python
  create_linked_clone("your_vm_name", "your_clone_name", "your_snapshot_name")
  ```

### Notes

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure `libvirt` and `qemu-img` are installed on your system.
2. **Disk Paths**: The script assumes your disk images are located in `/var/lib/libvirt/images/`. Adjust the paths if necessary.
3. **Permissions**: Make sure the script has appropriate permissions to read and write disk images.
4. **Simultaneous Usage**: The script creates linked clones using the specified backing files, allowing the original VM and its clones to run simultaneously without affecting each other.
5. **Independence**: After the clone is created, any changes to the original VM or its snapshots will not affect the existing clones, ensuring their independence.
